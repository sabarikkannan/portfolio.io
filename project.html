    <h1><b>1.Wireless charging using Electromagnetic induction</b></h1>
    <p>This project explores a wireless charging system based on electromagnetic induction for efficient power transfer.
        Comprising a transmitter and receiver unit, the system utilizes coils to establish mutual electromagnetic coupling. 
        The transmitter generates an alternating current, creating a magnetic field, while the receiver captures and converts 
        this energy into electricity. 
        The project focuses on optimizing coil configurations, addressing power losses, and integrating smart technologies for enhanced
         safety and control. 
        The system's applications span electric vehicles and portable electronics, contributing to the advancement of wireless charging 
        technologies for a more accessible and sustainable power future.</p>
    <h1>2.RFID Attendance using IoT</h1>
    <p>The RFID Attendance System employs RFID tags/cards, RFID readers, and NodeMCU connected to the cloud. Participants use RFID cards, 
        and NodeMCU captures and transmits data to a cloud database. Real-time attendance records are accessible via a user-friendly web 
        interface, offering scalability, cost-effectiveness, and secure data transmission. 
        The system streamlines attendance tracking for educational and organizational settings, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.</p>
    <h1>3.UHF RFID Attendance Monitoring system</h1>
    <p>The UHF RFID Attendance Monitoring System offers a contactless and efficient solution for attendance tracking. 
        Using Ultra-High-Frequency RFID technology, the system automates data collection, ensuring accuracy and reducing administrative overhead. 
        Key features include real-time processing, scalability, customizable reporting, and integration capabilities.
         The system enhances security and addresses the limitations of traditional attendance methods, providing a streamlined and 
         future-proof solution for diverse environments.</p>
